BUGS
====

* Evas: smart object doesn't work
* EdjeEdit: PartState API does not work


TODO
====

* evas.SmartObject
* edje: complete the unit tests
* elm.Web needs a test and a lot of work: signals and documentation
* include python-ethumb
* Review the internal functions and name them consistently
* Add more documentation for the use of callbacks
* Review and document our use of exceptions
* update links and text on:
  http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings
* Split base object defines from includes/efl.evas.pxd so that everything
  defined there doesn't get included to the C code that cimports it.
  This may have been fixed in latest versions of Cython.
* Add compatibility properties/methods for scrollables
* Check that all scrollable Elm widgets are documented as being such.
* Review the new elm list type object item system.
* Check for documentation changes.
* Elm Drag-n-Drop (in progress/kuuko)
* Unit tests for elm, things like top_widget and getting child objects
  can be done easily.

* New Elm documentation images with the new default theme.
* Images missing in the documentation:
   - datetime
   - video
   - web
   - window ?
