BUGS
====
* EdjeEdit: PartState API does not work
* Elm.Map: overlays_show segfaults, scrollers in examples are jumpy
* Genlist: "filter,done" event is not always fired (see the genlist_filter.py test)
* Elementary: when we use custom function callbacks we usually leak some
    reference around, some examples:
    - Fileselector.custom_filter_append()
    - Multibuttonentry.format_function_set()
    - Multibuttonentry.filter_append()
    - Multibuttonentry.filterprepend()
   ... maybe do like is done in genlist filter_set() ??
* API break in https://git.enlightenment.org/bindings/python/python-efl.git/commit/efl/elementary/label.pyx?id=9be98bb979917932cc2850a54f6e79281c871401 , find out if it had users anywhere, remove if not

Failing unit tests
------------------
* tests.edje.test_04_edit: testPartEffect (marked as known failure)
* tests.edje.test_04_edit: testGroupDel (skipped, segfault)
* tests.edje.test_04_edit: testExternal (skipped, TODO)

TODO
====
* update links and text on:
  http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings
  (requires fd.org shell account?)
* Review the internal functions and name them consistently
* edje: complete the unit tests
* Initial Evas GL support (for Elm)
* Add more documentation for callbacks, events, etc.
* Check for missing Eo type mappings

Elm
---
* Drag-n-Drop
* Automate compilation of the example edje files.
* Add more examples
* Prefs (only supports simple types, not so great for us)
* GLView
* Unit tests
* Images missing in the documentation:
   - datetime
   - systray
   - video
   - web
   - window ?
