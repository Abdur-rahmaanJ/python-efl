BUGS
====
* EdjeEdit: PartState API does not work
* Elm.Map: overlays_show segfaults, scrollers in examples are jumpy
* Genlist: "filter,done" event is sometimes fired before filter callbacks are done (see the genlist_filter.py test)

Failing unit tests
------------------
* tests.edje.test_04_edit: testPartEffect (marked as known failure)
* tests.edje.test_04_edit: testGroupDel (skipped, segfault)
* tests.edje.test_04_edit: testExternal (skipped, TODO)

TODO
====
* update links and text on:
  http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings
  (requires fd.org shell account?)
* Review the internal functions and name them consistently
* edje: complete the unit tests
* Initial Evas GL support (for Elm)
* Add more documentation for callbacks, events, etc.
* Check for missing Eo type mappings

Elm
