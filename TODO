BUGS
----

* EdjeEdit: PartState API does not work
* Edje.External: The unit test fails
* Elm.Configuration: example crashes
* Elm.EdjeExternal: examples don't work properly
* Elm.Map: overlays_show segfaults, scrollers in examples jump when menu opens


TODO
----

* edje: complete the unit tests
* include python-ethumb
* Review the internal functions and name them consistently
* Add more documentation for the use of callbacks
* Review and document our use of exceptions
* update links and text on:
  http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings
* Check for documentation changes.
* Use more _set_properties_from_keyword_args, replace Evas' _set_common_params
  with it?
* Check for missing properties <-> getter-/setter-functions
* Add more logging
* Evas: SmartObject needs testing, work. Make it inheritable by extension
  classes?
* Add missing Eo type mappings, mostly in Ecore

Elementary
==========

* Web needs a lot of work: signals and documentation
* Review the new container type object item system.
  Should the instance methods be classmethods instead?
* Drag-n-Drop (in progress/kuuko)
* Unit tests, things like top_widget and getting child objects
  can be done easily.
* Fix Theme API, add a test
* ObjectItem.data changed to dict (like in Eo). Find out what this affects
  and document it.
* Item add methods (constructors) should be changed to have cb_data in a
  single argument, not args, kwargs. The callback signatures need to be
  changed as well.
* Get rid of enums in __init__.py

* New documentation images with the new default theme.
* Images missing in the documentation:
   - datetime
   - video
   - web
   - window ?
