BUGS
====

* EdjeEdit: PartState API does not work (edje edit is disabled for now)
* Edje.External: The unit test fails (marked as known failure in unittest)
* Elm.Map: overlays_show segfaults, scrollers in examples jump when menu opens
* Bad binaries produced when build environment is invalid (T504)


TODO
====

* Improve, review and document our use of exceptions
* Check that README has all changes listed
* Overall API review

Elementary
----------

* Review the new container type object item system.
* Get rid of enums in __init__.py


TODO (optional)
===============

* Use more _set_properties_from_keyword_args, replace Evas' _set_common_params
  with it?
* update links and text on:
  http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings
  (requires fd.org shell account?)
* Add more documentation for callbacks, events, etc.

TODO (future)
=============

* Review the internal functions and name them consistently
* Evas: SmartObject needs testing, work. Make it inheritable by extension
  classes?
* Elm unit tests, things like top_widget and getting child objects
  can be done easily.
* include python-ethumb
* edje: complete the unit tests
* Initial Evas GL support (for Elm)

Elm
