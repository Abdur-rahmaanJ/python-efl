Style
=====

* For indentation, use *four space characters* per level of indentation.

* When comparing C pointers, use == and != instead of the python operator "is".
  This makes a visual distinction between C and py code and don't confuse the
  reader as "==" and "is" has different meaning in python.

Tips
====

* cython -a will generate a report that shows your cython code, and each line
  can be expanded by clicking to show the generated C code.

* cython does automatic dict <-> struct conversion with basic struct members

Ideas
=====

* Use a decorator for _METHOD_DEPRECATED
