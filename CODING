Style
=====

* For indentation, use *four space characters* per level of indentation.

* When comparing C pointers, use == and != . This makes a visual distinction.

Tips
====

* cython -a will generate a report that shows your cython code, and each line
  can be expanded by clicking to show the generated C code.

* cython does automatic dict <-> struct conversion with basic struct members

Ideas
=====

* Use a decorator for _METHOD_DEPRECATED
