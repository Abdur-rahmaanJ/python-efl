Style
=====

* For indentation, use *four space characters* per level of indentation.

* When comparing C pointers, use == and != instead of the python operator "is".
  This makes a visual distinction between C and py code and don't confuse the
  reader as "==" and "is" has different meaning in python.

* Internal utility functions used in the bindings must start with an
  underscore and must have the shortest name as possible.

Design patterns
===============
 * From "The Zen of Python":

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Tips
====

* cython -a will generate a report that shows your cython code, and each line
  can be expanded by clicking to show the generated C code.

* cython does automatic dict <-> struct conversion with basic struct members

Ideas
=====

* Use a decorator for _METHOD_DEPRECATED
